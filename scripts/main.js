Just like programming. There could have thousand ways to solve the same problem.</p>"+

By fully immersed myself into another country, culture and way of life, I realized that social work is not the only way to help others. By starting my programming journey, I love the infinite possibilities made by programming immediately. It is not only about 0s and 1s, but also the thinking skill which breaking down large, complex problems into simple pieces. Similar to Social Work.</p>"+
