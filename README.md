## Welcome to Learning coco

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi I am Coco from Hong Kong who are studying in programming. I can write some simple HTML, CSS, JS, SQLite and Python. I just finished the [cs50](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x) course which it full of fun and working hard on Django and jQuery recently via [CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-computer-science-for-web-programming).
  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am going to record my progress and notes in the webpage and hope it would be useful. <br>
  Welcome to be one of my Learning buddies in [Learning Coco](https://www.learningcoco.ga/).
